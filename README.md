# Business/Saas landing page

## Description

**Business/Saas landing page** is a NextJS14 landing page for what could be a business, a Saas product etc. I used a CMS template design to create this one page landing page in NextJS. I added animations when sections scroll into view. If you need a custom landing page for your Saas Product or your business or a product and have a design, I will be able to create NextJS web page. I took two days to complete this page
